# NodeJs, ExpressJs, Mongodb

#Welcome to the README file for my DriveTest Project!

Drive Test is a web-based application built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The main purpose of this application is to help users to book a driving test online. The application has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and access different features.

The application allows users to create an account, log in, and start practicing. Once the user logs in, they can select different types of tests, such as a G2, G License driving test. 

The Drive Test Portal has three types of users: drivers, examiners, and admins, each with a unique login and sign-up functionalities.

Drivers can create an account by providing their personal information, such as their name, email, and password. Once they have created an account, they can access different features, such as taking driving tests, tracking their progress, and viewing their test scores.

Examiners can also create an account by providing their personal information. After logging in, examiners can access features like creating and grading tests, reviewing driver progress, and providing feedback.

Admins have the highest level of access and can manage the entire system. They can create and manage user accounts, view and edit test data, and perform other administrative tasks.

The portal's login functionality verifies the user's credentials before granting access to their account, and the signup functionality validates user input to ensure that all necessary information is provided. These functionalities provide a secure and user-friendly experience for drivers, examiners, and admins.

The application uses MongoDB to store user data, including test results and progress. And Site is hosted on the Heroku server.



#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you've done that, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Start the server by running npm start.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.



#Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

app.js - This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the server and connects to the database.
routes - This directory contains the route definitions for the application.
models - This directory contains the Mongoose schema definitions for the resources in the application.
controllers - This directory contains the controller functions for each route.
views - This directory contains the EJS templates for rendering the views in the application.
public - This directory contains static files (e.g. CSS, images) for the application.



#Here are the main dependencies used in this project:

express - A popular Node.js web framework for building APIs.
mongoose - A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
ejs - A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
body-parser - A middleware for parsing request bodies.


#Conclusion
That's it! You should now have a basic understanding of how to use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB together to build a web application. Happy coding!

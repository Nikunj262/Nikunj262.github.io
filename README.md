# NodeJs, ExpressJs, Mongodb

#Welcome to the README file for my DriveTest Project!

This project is designed to showcase how to use these technologies together to build a web application. It includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a simple resource, and can be used as a starting point for building more complex applications.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. Once you've done that, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.
Start the server by running npm start.
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.



#Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

app.js - This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the server and connects to the database.
routes - This directory contains the route definitions for the application.
models - This directory contains the Mongoose schema definitions for the resources in the application.
controllers - This directory contains the controller functions for each route.
views - This directory contains the EJS templates for rendering the views in the application.
public - This directory contains static files (e.g. CSS, images) for the application.



#Here are the main dependencies used in this project:

express - A popular Node.js web framework for building APIs.
mongoose - A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
ejs - A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
body-parser - A middleware for parsing request bodies.


#Conclusion
That's it! You should now have a basic understanding of how to use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB together to build a web application. Happy coding!
